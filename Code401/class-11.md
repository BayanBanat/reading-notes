**Reading Questions :**
1. Compared to Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab offers a more comprehensive and flexible user interface. It provides a multi-document interface,
  a modular and extensible architecture, and a more streamlined and organized working environment. While Jupyter Notebook focuses primarily
  on notebook functionality, JupyterLab expands on it by integrating notebooks with other features, such as a file browser, code editor, terminal, and more.
  ***the key features and benefits of JupyterLab:***
  * Multiple Document Interface: JupyterLab offers a tab-based interface, allowing you to work with multiple notebooks, code files, and data files simultaneously in a single window. This makes it easier to organize and switch between different tasks or projects.

  * Flexible Layout: JupyterLab allows you to arrange and customize the layout of the interface according to your needs. You can stack, tile, or tab different panels, including notebooks, consoles, code editors, file browsers, and more.

  * Integrated Code Editor: JupyterLab includes a powerful code editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and code linting. It supports multiple programming languages and provides a rich editing experience for writing and editing code.

  * Enhanced Notebook Functionality: JupyterLab retains all the features of Jupyter Notebook, such as creating, editing, and running notebooks, which combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It also supports kernel-based execution for a wide range of programming languages.

  * Rich Display Capabilities: JupyterLab allows you to create interactive visualizations, charts, and dashboards using popular data visualization. It supports the display of rich media formats such as images, videos, and HTML.

  * Extension Ecosystem: JupyterLab has a modular architecture that supports extensions, allowing you to enhance its functionality and customize the user interface. There is a growing ecosystem of extensions that provide additional features and integrations, including debugging, version control, and more.

  * File Browsing and Management: JupyterLab includes a file browser that enables you to navigate and manage your files and directories. You can create, rename, delete, and move files and folders directly from the interface.

  * Terminal Access: JupyterLab provides an integrated terminal, allowing you to run command-line operations without leaving the environment. This is particularly useful for running system commands or interacting with command-line tools.
