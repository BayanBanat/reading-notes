Random number generation is useful for tasks such as generating test data and simulating user behavior.
Test coverage is important for ensuring that the software is working as expected and preventing bugs and errors from reaching production.
By generating random scenarios and analyzing their outcomes, analysts can better understand and manage potential risks.

**Reading Questions:**
1.
  1. Generating random integers
  To print a random integer between 1 and 10, you can use the randint() function:
  ```
  import random
  print random.randint(0, 10)
  ```
  2. Making random selections from a list
   ```
   import random
   myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
   random.choice(myList)
   ```
   3. Generating random floating-point numbers
   ```
   import random
   random.random() * 100
   ```
   * the most commonly used functions:
       * random()
       * randint(a, b)
       * choice(seq)
       * shuffle(seq)
       
2. * risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of 
     assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.
    * the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
      . Identify potential risks
      . Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk
      . Prioritize risks
      . Develop strategies to mitigate or manage risks
      . Monitor and reassess risks
      
3.  * Test coverage is indicates how much of the software has been tested by the test cases.
    * Test coverage is important in software testing because it helps to identify areas of the code that have not been tested, allowing for gaps in testing to be addressed. This can help to 
      improve the overall quality of the software, reduce the risk of bugs and defects, and increase confidence in the software's reliability and stability.
     
 4. * Big O notation describes how an algorithm's performance changes as the size of the input increases. It helps us to analyze the worst-case scenario of an algorithm, i.e., 
      the maximum amount of time or space an algorithm might take given a certain input.
     * One example of an everyday task that demonstrates O(n) time complexity is counting the number of items in a grocery bag. Suppose you have a bag of groceries containing n items,
       such as apples, oranges, and bananas. To count the number of items in the bag, you need to look at each item once and increment a counter by one for each item. Thus, the time required to count all the items in the bag is proportional to the size of the bag, or O(n) time complexity.
