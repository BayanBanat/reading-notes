## DSA Review
**Reading Questions :**
1. * **Communicate:** The most important skill to prepare prior to a whiteboard interview is effective communication. Communicate your thought process, clarify the problem, discuss potential solutions, and seek affirmation throughout the interview.
   * **Restate the Question:** After the interviewer presents the problem, take the time to restate the question to ensure you fully understand it. Seeking affirmation from the interviewer demonstrates your ability to articulate problems and provides you with a chance to clarify any misunderstandings.
   * **Ask About Edge Cases:** Before diving into solving the problem, inquire about potential edge cases related to inputs and expected outputs. This shows your analytical skills and attention to detail in preventing bugs that might arise due to edge cases.
   * **Ask About Test Cases:** Inquire whether there are specific test cases that the solution should pass. This not only demonstrates your understanding of testing but also highlights your thoroughness in addressing various scenarios.
   * **Write Pseudocode and Validate Logic:** Instead of immediately writing code, start by creating pseudocode for your solution. Present your pseudocode to the interviewer and ask for their input. This can help you identify logical flaws and refine your approach before writing actual code.
   * **Write the Actual Code and Validate Again:** Convert your validated pseudocode into actual code. You can still leave the comments from your pseudocode. Once again, ask the interviewer if your solution looks good or if they have any suggestions for improvement.
   * **Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help:** If you encounter difficulties during the interview, it's acceptable to ask for help in a conversational manner. Phrase your request for assistance politely and openly, and the interviewer may provide useful tips to guide you.
   * **Pre-Interview Communication:** If possible, communicate with your HR or interview point of contact before the interview. Ask about the format of the interview, the type of questions to expect, and any specific preparation advice. This information can help you tailor your practice and mental preparation.
   * **Remember We're All Human:** Keep in mind that interviewers understand the stress of technical interviews, and they have likely been in your shoes. Openly discussing problems in a conversational manner can set you apart from other candidates and make a positive impression.
   * **Reflect on Personal Experience:** The article encourages readers to reflect on their own experiences with whiteboard interviews. Share experiences where communication saved you, and consider times when better communication could have improved the outcome.
2. * **Take a few minutes to think:** Many candidates tend to rush into speaking and coding right after the problem is presented. However, it's important to take a moment to gather your thoughts and plan your approach before diving into the solution. The article suggests that instead of immediately trying to fill the silence with talking, take a minute or two to think about the problem in depth. Use this time to consider the problem's requirements, constraints, and possible strategies for solving it. This gives you a chance to create a solid mental framework before you start explaining your solution to the interviewer.
     You can communicate your intention to the interviewer: "If it's okay with you, I'm just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I'll start talking." This approach helps you avoid the pressure of simultaneously talking and thinking, allowing you to present a well-structured solution when you do start explaining.
   * **Write down the steps of the solution:** Before you begin writing code on the whiteboard, it's recommended to outline the high-level steps of your solution in a clear and organized manner. You don't need to write detailed code at this stage; instead, focus on jotting down the logical sequence of actions you'll take to solve the problem.
     By writing down the steps, you provide yourself with a visual guide to follow while explaining your solution. This also helps you ensure that you're covering all the necessary aspects of the problem without getting lost in the details. Moreover, having a clear plan laid out on the whiteboard can make it easier for the interviewer to follow your thought process and understand your approach.

3. * **Technical Knowledge:** McDowell stresses the importance of having a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving. Candidates should review key concepts and practice solving coding problems.
   * **Practice Coding Problems:** McDowell recommends practicing a variety of coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal. She suggests working on problems of increasing difficulty to build problem-solving skills.
   * **Mock Interviews:** Conducting mock interviews with peers or mentors is crucial. This helps simulate the interview experience and allows you to receive feedback on your performance.
   * **Behavioral Interviews:** McDowell also addresses the importance of preparing for behavioral interviews. This includes being able to discuss your past experiences, projects, and skills effectively.
   * **Resume Preparation:** Crafting a well-organized and impactful resume is key to catching the attention of potential employers. Highlight relevant experiences, skills, and projects.
   * **Communication Skills:** McDowell emphasizes the need to communicate clearly during interviews. Candidates should explain their thought processes, ask clarifying questions, and discuss their approach to solving problems.
   * **Time Management:** During technical interviews, efficient time management is crucial. McDowell suggests practicing problems within time limits to improve your speed without sacrificing accuracy.
   * **Company Research:** Research the companies you're interviewing with. Understand their culture, values, and the types of questions they typically ask during interviews.
   * **Continuous Learning:** Interview preparation is an ongoing process. Regularly practice coding problems and revisit key concepts to stay sharp.
