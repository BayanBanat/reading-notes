Taking a break and doing something else, even for just a few minutes, can help you clear your mind and approach the problem from a fresh perspective when you return. Try going for a walk, doing some stretching, or listening to music to help you relax and refocus.**
   
   - **Break the Problem Down into Smaller Parts: When a problem seems overwhelming, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Identify the different parts of the problem and focus on solving each one individually. This can help you make progress and feel less overwhelmed, while also helping you identify any gaps in your understanding.**
    
   - **Seek Help and Collaboration: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck! Reach out to colleagues, mentors, or online communities for advice and support. Collaborating with others can help you see the problem from new angles, get feedback on your ideas, and learn from other people's experiences. Working with others can also help you stay motivated and accountable as you work through the problem.**
